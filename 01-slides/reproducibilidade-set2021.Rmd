# Introduction

Governance and reproducibility are required policies for a sustainable science!

--

- Can we trust results by their face values?
- Can we trust academics by their word? 

--

Solution?

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width=250}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/359_9_f2.jpeg')
```

]

.pull-right[

- All data and code should be shared and reproducible
- Academic governance and self-audit
- If results are not reproducible, be transparent about it and retract if needed
-

# Reproducibility failures in academia

## [Reinhart-Rogoff](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646) error

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/reinhart-rogoff.png')
```

## The recent [case](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/08/researchers-forfeit-10000-award-when-papers-findings-cant-be-replicated/) of _Journal of Finance_:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/retraction-jf.png')
```

# Why we lack reproducibility?

- researchers are human!

--

- bad incentives: publish or perish! 

-- 

- bad computational policies (aka "it works on my machine")

---

# Tools for reproducibility

- Version control (data/code/..) 
  - Github (and friends)
  - Dropbox/GoogleDrive/OneDrive/...

--

- Intructions for running the code (perhaps in a code script?)

--

- Well written paper!
