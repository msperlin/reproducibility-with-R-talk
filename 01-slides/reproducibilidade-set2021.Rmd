# Introduction

[What is science?](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+science&oq=what+is+science&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l10.2032j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

> the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Oxford English Dictionary

However, academic research is usually conducted in a black-box fashion

```{r, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/Sidney-Harris-cartoon-main-image.jpg')
```


# How to solve this problem?

Reproducibility!

```{r, out.width=250}

```

]

.pull-right[

- All data and code should be shared and reproducible
- Academic governance and self-audit
- If results are not reproducible, be transparent about it and retract if needed
-

# Reproducibility failures in academia

## [Reinhart-Rogoff](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646) error

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/reinhart-rogoff.png')
```

## The recent [case](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/08/researchers-forfeit-10000-award-when-papers-findings-cant-be-replicated/) of _Journal of Finance_:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/retraction-jf.png')
```

# Why we lack reproducibility?

- researchers are human!

--

- bad incentives: publish or perish! 

-- 

- bad computational policies (aka "it works on my machine")

---

# Tools for reproducibility

- Version control (data/code/..) 
  - Github (and friends)
  - Dropbox/GoogleDrive/OneDrive/...

--

- Intructions for running the code (perhaps in a code script?)

--

- Well written paper!
